Mutation++ is an open-source library originally developed at the [von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics](https://www.vki.ac.be), designed to couple with conventional computational fluid dynamics codes to provide thermodynamic, transport, chemistry, and energy transfer properties associated with subsonic to hypersonic flows.
